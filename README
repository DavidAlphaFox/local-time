The LOCAL-TIME library is a Common Lisp library for the manipulation
of dates and times.  It is based almost entirely upon Erik Naggum's
paper "The Long Painful History of Time" [1].  In that paper, Naggum
outlined a system that here has been implemented, mostly.

USAGE

<> define-timezone zone-name zone-file &key (load nil)

Define zone-name (a symbol or a string) as a new timezone, lazy-loaded
from zone-file (a pathname designator relative to the
zoneinfo directory on this system.  If load is true, load immediately.

<> *default-timezone*

The variable *default-timezone* contains the timezone that will be
used by default if none is specified.  It is loaded from
/etc/localtime when the library is loaded.

<> +utc-time+

The variable +utc-zone+ contains a timezone corresponding to UTC.

<> day-of local-time

Returns the day component of the time.  Although the paper specifies
that the day should be a signed fixnum, it is left unbounded for
flexibility reasons.

<> sec-of local-time

Returns the 'seconds' component of the time.  Valid values for the
seconds range from 0 to 86399.

<> nsec-of local-time

Returns the 'microseconds' component of the time.  Valid values for
the nanoseconds range from 0 to 999999999.

<> make-local-time &key :day :sec :nsec :timezone

This macro creates an instance of a local-time

<> unix-time local-time

This function returns the date/time specified in LOCAL-TIME encoded as
the number of seconds since January 1st, 1970 12:00am UTC.  It
corresponds with the time received from the POSIX call time().

<> timezone local-time &optional timezone

Returns as multiple values the time zone as the number of seconds east
of UTC, a boolean daylight-saving-p, the customary abbreviation of the
timezone, the starting time of this timezone, and the ending time of
this timezone.

<> local-time-adjust source timezone &optional (destination nil)

Returns two values, the values of new DAY and SEC slots, or, if
DESTINATION is a LOCAL-TIME instance, fills the slots with the new
values and returns the destination

<> local-time-adjust-days local-time offset &key into

Adds OFFSET to the days of LOCAL-TIME.  If OFFSET is a keyword
symbol and then name of a weekday, the result is the previous day
of the week from LOCAL-TIME.

<> local-time-whole-year-difference time-a time-b

Returns the number of whole years elapsed between time-a and time-b.
This is useful for calculating anniversaries and birthdays.

<> days-in-month month year

Returns the number of days in a given month of the specified year.

<> maximize-time-part local-time &key timezone into

Returns a local-time with the time set to the end of the day.

<> minimize-time-part local-time &key timezone into

Returns a local-time with the time part set to the beginning of the day.

<> first-day-of-year local-time-or-year &key timezone into

Returns a local-time containing the first day of the year.  The year
may be taken from a local-time or an integer.

<> last-day-of-year

Returns a local-time containing the last day of the year.  The year
may be taken from a local-time or an integer.

<> with-decoded-local-time (&key nsec sec minute hour day month year
                                 day-of-week daylight-p timezone)
                                 local-time
                            &body body

This macro binds variables to the decoded elements of the given
localtime.

<> encode-local-time ns ss mm hh day month year &optional timezone

Returns a new LOCAL-TIME instance corresponding to the specified time
elements.

<> local-time &key universal internal unix (nsec 0) zone

Produces a LOCAL-TIME instance from the provided numeric time
representation.

<> now

This function returns a LOCAL-TIME corresponding to the current time.

<> today

This function returns a LOCAL-TIME corresponding to the midnight of the
current day.

<> local-time< time-a time-b
<> local-time<= time-a time-b
<> local-time> time-a time-b
<> local-time>= time-a time-b
<> local-time= time-a time-b
<> local-time/= time-a time-b

These comparison functions act like their string and char counterparts.

<> local-time-designator real-number

This function returns NIL, as it has not yet been implemented.

<> local-time-day-of-week local-time

This function returns the index of the day of the week, starting at 0.

<> decode-local-time local-time

Returns the decoded time as multiple values: ns, ss, mm, hh, day,
month, year, day-of-week, daylight-saving-time-p, timezone, and the
customary timezone abbreviation.

<> parse-timestring timestring &key (start 0) (end nil)
                    (junk-allowed nil)

Parses a timestring and returns the corresponding LOCAL-TIME.  Parsing
begins at START and stops at the END position.  If junk-allowed is T,
ignores any invalid characters within the timestring.

<> format-timestring stream local-time universal-p timezone-p
                     &optional date-elements time-elements
                               date-separator time-separator
                               internal-separator

Produces on stream the timestring corresponding to the LOCAL-TIME with
the given options.  If STREAM is NIL, returns a string containing what
would have been the output.  If STREAM is T, prints the string to
*standard-output*.

<> universal-time local-time

Returns the UNIVERSAL-TIME corresponding to the LOCAL-TIME.
Microseconds are lost.

<> internal-time local-time

Returns the internal system time corresponding to the LOCAL-TIME.
Currently unimplemented due to portability concerns.

<> local-timezone adjusted-local-time &optional timezone

Return the local timezone adjustment applicable at the already
adjusted-local-time.  Used to reverse the effect of TIMEZONE and
LOCAL-TIME-ADJUST.

<> enable-read-macros

Adds @TIMESTRING and #@UNIVERSAL-TIME as reader macros.

<> astronomical-julian-date local-time

Returns the julian date of the date portion of LOCAL-TIME.

<> modified-julian-date local-time

Returns the modified julian date of the date portion of LOCAL-TIME.

CAVEATS

This implementation assumes that time zone information is stored in
the tzfile format.  The default timezone is loaded from
/etc/localtime.  This will likely break on non-POSIX systems.
